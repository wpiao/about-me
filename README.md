# LAB - 02, 03, 04, 05b

## About Me, with a guessing game

### Lab 02 - 1/13/2021
It is basic one page static html shows my bio, education, job experience, and my goals. The page prompts 5 yes/no questions to users to interact with them. This feature is built by JS. 

### Lab 03 - 1/16/2021
Built off of lab-02. Add two additionl questions by using new data type - array and while/for loop. I Made code more DRY by putting all of the questions, answers, and responses to the first five yes/no questions into arrays and used for/while loop to iterate each question. So I didn't have to write similar codes five times. 

### Lab 04 - 1/20/2021 - Wenhao Piao - Navigator, Marie Marcos - Driver
In lab-04, we refactor the base code of lab-03, we moved the logic for all questions into functions.

### Lab 05b - 1/23/2021
Final polishing, cleaned the code (remove all console.log), deployed the app to GitHub Pages.
